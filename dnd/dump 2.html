        <p>If you’re randomly generating treasure troves using the OD&D guidelines, then most intelligent foes will have a 10-15% chance of having one or more treasure maps (<a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1900/roleplaying-games/treasure-maps-the-unknown-goals-in-the-megadungeon">link</a>)</p>

        <p>Tunnel of Black Rainbows</p>

        <p>Mechanically, a +2 longsword magically gives you a +2 bonus to your attack and damage rolls.

            Okay, but what does that mean? Is the blade preternaturally sharp? Does the magical enhancement guide your thrusts? Does it grant you a moment of combat-oriented prescience at the moment you begin to swing your blade, allowing you to see the outcome of the stroke and adjust it accordingly? Is it perfectly balanced, yet light and lively in your hand? Does the edge of the blade morph from diamond sharpness (for piercing armor) to vicious serrations (to rip and tear at flesh) in the middle of a blow? Can you feel the tendril of its mystic energy reaching into your mind and there implanting the arcane combat techniques of the Obsidian Brothers — techniques that you can scarcely comprehend? Does your arm grow in strength and speed when you hold the blade? Does the blade glow with a light that only you can see, but which seems to limn your targets in crystal clarity?

        <p>A blindfold that can be seen through as if it wasn’t there</p>

        <p>A common and valuable bit of advice for writers and storytellers is to remember all five senses. This is doubly important for DMs.</p>

        <p>have a tavern among its rooms or a gala happening in some mysterious ballroom</p>

        <p>a puzzle that requires a Performance check to solve, or a guard that can be persuaded to allow the adventurers to pass are definitely things that wouldn’t feel out of place in a dungeon. Similarly, religious or primordial symbols could require your clerics or druids to make some checks, or heavy equipment could require your fighter in order to lift it.

        <p>Having monsters who may roam the space or having a table for possible random encounters that could occur inside the dungeon raises the threat level of the adventure.</p>

        <p>Include encounters that tempt them to spend some of their spell slots or items without immediately giving them the option to replenish them.</p>

        <p>“Check for traps” isn’t magic, typically (unless they literally cast find traps). Make the player tell you where they check for traps and how they do it. If they want to do a more general sweep of the room, raise the DC of the skill check.</p>

        <p>Have trap trigger thresholds in your skill check DCs. It’s actually somewhat tricky to check for a trap without accidentally triggering it. If your skill check DC for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for looking for a trap is 15, and their check is fairly far below that, it sure would be a shame if that trap went off.</p>

        <p>Don’t Be in the Dark About Darkvision</p>

        <p>A dungeon is a focused location with fixed boundaries and meaningful choices.</p>

        <p>Why are the characters going there? What's the goal? Dungeons are dangerous. You'd only go into one if you had a good reason.</p>

        <p>What is the dungeon's purpose? Who built it and why? What is it used for now?</p>

        <p>What entrances does the dungeon have?</p>

        <p>posibilidad de que ellos puedan ir dibujando el mapa cuando exploren, capaz en un papelito o pizarra / hoja plastificada. siento q es más realista y divertido si lo van dibujando ellos q si lo voy develando / dibujandno yo.</p>

        <p>^^parar esto como queda pintar hojas a4 con un poquito de te, y darles lapiceras negras, para q quede facherito y además es una feature q no se puede borrar y bueno q tachen y quede lo q quede <--- obvio qvan a haber muchas hojas, más de las q precisan, pueden usar muchas.</p>

        <p>Remember that characters with darkvision are still are at disadvantage on Perception checks in total darkness.</p>

        <p><a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/47302/roleplaying-games/lore-of-sagrathea-experimental-potion-workbook">experimental potion workbook</a> no usaría esas pociones pero fitting concept</p>
        
        <p>picking a lock doesn’t carry any risk or cost. Unless you determine the lock might break. Or the lock picks. Or there’s a chance someone on the other side might hear the lock picking attempt. Maybe they get to roll a check.</p>
