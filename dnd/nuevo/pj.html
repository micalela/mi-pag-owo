    <h1>mi pj</h1>

    <div class="caja">
        <p>she grew up with a family of elves and studied magic on a prestigious academy, giving it her all and not having much free time because that was her family's elven culture. 
        she then started longing for a different life and to experience things outside academia and thus embarked on a journey away from home and into an uncertain future</p>

        <p>
          Possible Reasons for Tiredness:
          <ul>
<li>Rigid Structure: <br>
Wizard academies often have strict rules and schedules, which can feel stifling to a character who prefers a more spontaneous and free-wheeling approach to magic.</li> <br>
<li>Theoretical Focus: <br>
The emphasis on theoretical knowledge and arcane research might not appeal to a wizard who is more interested in practical applications and hands-on experience.</li> <br>
<li>Limited Spell Selection: <br>
Academies may restrict access to certain types of magic, particularly those considered dangerous or unorthodox. This could frustrate a character who is drawn to forbidden or experimental magic.</li> <br>
<li>Monotony of Studies: <br>
The daily grind of classes, lectures, and spell research can become tedious, even for the most dedicated student.</li> <br>
<li>Lack of Adventure: <br>
The academic life can be isolated from the exciting adventures and challenges that a wizard might seek. This can lead to a desire for something more than just studying.</li> <br>
<li>Social Disconnect: <br>
A wizard might feel out of place or isolated from their peers, particularly if they are more interested in solitary research or have a different personality type than their classmates.</li> <br>
<li>Forbidden Magic: <br>
A wizard might have a deep-seated interest in "forbidden" or "dark" magic, leading them to clash with the academy's rules and potentially face expulsion or exile. </li> <br>
Potential Character Traits and Backstory:
<li>Independent Thinker: <br>
The wizard might be a free spirit who questions authority and challenges the established norms of the academy.</li> <br>
<li>Rebellious Streak: <br>
The character might have a tendency to break the rules or engage in prohibited activities, leading to conflicts with the academy's staff and potentially expulsion.</li> <br>
<li>Secretly Studying Forbidden Magic: <br>
The wizard might be secretly delving into forbidden arts, perhaps seeking knowledge that the academy deems too dangerous or unethical.</li> <br>
<li>Yearning for Adventure: <br>
The character might be bored with the academic life and yearn for the excitement and challenges of the outside world.</li> <br>
<li>Seeking a Mentor: <br>
The wizard might be looking for a more experienced guide or mentor outside the academy, someone who can help them hone their skills and unlock their true potential.</li> <br>
<li>Disenchanted with Magic: <br>
The wizard might have become disillusioned with the academic approach to magic and is seeking a new path or purpose.</li> <br>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Raised and trained in a horrible wizard school, he yearns to return a hero with great powers and lord it over his teachers and former fellow students.</p>

        <p>The PC is being forced into marriage against his will. He flees instead, determined to use his wits and growing magic powers to make a name for himself in the world.</p>

        <p>The character wants to setup a simple alchemist shop, brew potent potions and become a secret power who manipulates the nobility</p>

        <p>A battlemage since birth, he is tired of war and went AWOL a few weeks ago. He is uncertain if the military hunts him, but if so, there will be other battlemages as part of the hunting unit(s).</p>
